Project 1 explores cubic splines and the deBoor algorithm. Above are some sample images created by the program. The right is a cubic spline and the left its basis functions visualized. Please take a look at the [pdf](https://github.com/NilRom/UNI/files/7260738/project02.pdf) for a full outline of the project.
