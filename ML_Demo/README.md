# Object Detection Demo
Hi! This is a demo of the object detection model I implemented at XPL. Please see the file "Demo.ipynb" for a demonstration of what the model does. I can unfortunately not share the code for the real model and I am therefore using Pytorch's faster R-CNN pretrained on COCO. However this is very similar to what I implemented at XPL.

## Tutorial
If you want to try the model on your own image. Please clone the repo, add your image to the input folder and specify the path name in the demo notebook. Make sure the image is a .jpeg or .png file.
