# Tutorial

Hi! This is a demo of the object detection model I implemented at XPL. Please see the file "Demo.ipynb" for a demonstration of what the model does. I can unfortunately not share the code for the real model and I am therefore using Pytorch's faster R-CNN pretrained on COCO. However this is very similar to what I implemented at XPL.
