Hello!
This is my backup of projects at university. Due to confidentiality reasons I can not share the projects from past work experiance. If you want to take a look at those projects, please let me know and I will ask past employers for permission to share. 

The directory 'Finite element method' contain the files for a project in finite element analysis. Please take a look at the first pdf file for an outline of the project.

The directory "Java second course" contain files from my second course of Java programming at university.

The directory "Numerical methods for differential equations" contain pyhton files used for solving differential equations numerically.
