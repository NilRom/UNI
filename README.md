# My Projects
Hello!
This is my backup of personal computer projects. Due to confidentiality reasons I can not share the projects from past work experiance. If you want to take a look at those projects, please let me know and I will ask past employers for permission to share. 

## [(WIP) Supervised Learning Sand-Box](https://github.com/NilRom/UNI/tree/main/misc/ds_sand_box)
This is a web-app where the user can customize, train and test a supervised ML model on toy openML datasets or a custom csv file. The program will automatically detect if it is a classification or regression problem and create a basic pre-processing pipeline to fit the uploaded toy dataset. The app is available [here.](https://github.com/NilRom/UNI/tree/main/misc/ds_sand_box)

## [Object Detection Demo](https://github.com/NilRom/UNI/tree/main/object_detection_demo)
This folder contains a sample demo of the object detection model I implemented at XPL. Naturally, this is not the project itself but rather a demo of what it does.

## [MNIST Live Classifier](https://github.com/NilRom/UNI/tree/main/misc/MNIST_live_classifier_app)

This is another toy web-app that I created after having learnt the basics of pytorch. It enables the user to draw an MNIST-like digit and having it classified by a pretrained digit classifier. Try it out [here.](https://github.com/NilRom/UNI/tree/main/misc/MNIST_live_classifier_app)
