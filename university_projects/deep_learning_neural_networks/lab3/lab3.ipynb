    "In this exercise you will: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Train CNNs for a binary classification problem\n",
    "* Visualize how CNNs interprets the data\n",
    "* Train CNNs for two 3-class classification problem\n",
    "* Train a RNN on a time series prediction problem\n",
    "* Visualize RNN hidden node activities\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will look at network architectures that are designed to handle specific kinds of data. Convolutional Neural Networks for image processing and Recurrent Neural Networks for time series processing\n",

    "## The data\n",
    "Digits \"5\" and \"6\" from the MNIST database used for a binary classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dataset consisting of circles, rectangles or triangles, that can be read using the *loadImagesCRT* function.\n",

    "A dataset consisting of pairs of times series. The input time series is a train of rectangle pulses, and the output is triangles, i.e. an up-ramp followed by a down-ramp. For more details see the cell *Ex4-1*. The task is to train a recurrent network that predicts the triangle time series from the pulse time series.\n",

    "## CNN for image classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first exercise you are going to train a CNN that can separate between numbers \"5\" and \"6\" from the mnist dataset (mnist56 dataset). We are going to use 2000 training images and 1850 validation images. To start with we have a proposed CNN that can solve this problem. It consists of the following:\n",
    "* First convolutional layer consisting of 4 kernels of size 3x3, with ReLU activation\n",
    "* Maxpooling of size 2x2\n",
    "* Second convolutional layer of 4 kernels of size 3x3, with ReLU activation\n",
    "* Maxpooling of size 2x2\n",
    "* Special layer *Flatten()*, just transforms the all of the max pooled filter outputs to a linear vector of outputs\n",
    "* *Dense* layer, meaning a fully connected MLP layer, to 10 hidden nodes, again ReLU activation\n",
    "* Final output layer consisting of one single output node with sigmoid activation function because we have a binary classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default is to use *stride* = 1 and no *padding*. \n",

    "#### Question 2\n",
    "This image classification problem should be relatively easy since a \"5\" has some distinct differences from a \"6\". Experiment with the architecture of the CNN model and try to make it smaller (in terms of the number of trainable parameters), but with the same almost perfect validation accuracy (>98%). **How many parameters do you have in your trimmed model?
