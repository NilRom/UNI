- I can't prewhite x similar to how we did in lab2. Is that a problem? A: Not really

- Is it ok, to just guess untill we get a white residual for the model orders in the BJ polys? A:YES

- How do you formulate diofantine equations when you have a BJ model? PAGE  A:245 in book is good

- What is the purpose of jusing prediction at t to predict t+9|t A:Just do it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- What is a good residual variance? Better than Naive

- How much can we expect to reduce the variance when we add one more column? No idea

- What is a good Naive comparison? Guess yesterdays value? thats good

- How warm start on test set? Run through all data and extract test validation seperatley

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  How to formulate state-space representation of BJ model? Easier to rewrite as an ARMAX and then use book?
- Should I put all the dynamics in the C matrix? YES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- How come my parameter estimation gets F:ed when I include an exo term
- Help with prediction step
- How to deal with exo when doing prediction in Kalman? Estimate it? How? 




ToDo:
Change prediction to include all data and then extract to get rid of warm start problem DONE
